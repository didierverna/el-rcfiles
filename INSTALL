* Installation

** Prerequisites
You must use GNU Make with this standalone distribution.

** Edit Makefile.inc
This file is located at the top of the distribution. Look at the various
settings and adjust them as you see fit.

** Build the library
Type `make' to do that. This step is optional if you plan on installing in one
of the ways described below (it will be performed implicitely).

** Install the library
There are three ways to install the library: either manually, or by using one
of the methods below.

- If you're installing for XEmacs, you must use `make install-pkg' to install
  as an XEmacs package. Note that there is preliminary support for installing
  as a GNU Emacs package, but it doesn't really work out of the box right now
  (GNU Emacs doesn't support the notion of user-level packages yet).

- If you're installing for GNU Emacs, you must use `make install'.

** Uninstalling the library
Depending on the installation type, you can uninstall with either `make
uninstall' or `make uninstall-pkg'.

** Additional documentation formats
If the library provides some documentation, it is built as Info files by
default. You can however build it in other formats by typing `make FORMAT' in
the doc/ subdirectory. FORMAT is one of `dvi', `ps', `pdf', `html'. The HTML
version is built in its own .html subdirectory of doc/.

Note that only the Info documentation is automatically installed.


	Have fun!
