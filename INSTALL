			  HOW TO INSTALL THE PACKAGE


* Copyright (C) 2011 Didier Verna

* Installation

** Please note
You must use GNU Make with this standalone distribution.

** Edit Makefile.inc
This file is located at the top of the distribution. It allows you to specify
the Emacs executable and some auxiliary programs to use, the installation
location and whether to install by symlink or copy.

** Build the package
Type `make' to do that. This builds up the elc files and, if there is one, the
documentation in info format.

** Install as an Emacs package
Type `make install-pkg' to do that. If you want another kind of installation,
you will have to use your little fingers.

** Other useful targets
You can uninstall as a package by typing `make uninstall-pkg'. If there is
one, you can build the documentation in other formats by typing `make FORMAT'
in the doc/ subdirectory. FORMAT is one of `dvi', `ps', `pdf', `html'. The
HTML version is built in its own .html subdirectory of doc/.


	Have fun!
