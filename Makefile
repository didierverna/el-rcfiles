### Code:

hack: all

include Makefile.prj
include Makefile.inc

-include local.prj
-include local.inc

all:
	$(MAKE) gen TARGET=all

# #### NOTE: this one is needed because we have an INSTALL file in this
# directory, and this will conflict with a default install target on OSX where
# file names are case-insensitive.
install:
	$(MAKE) gen TARGET=install

gen:
	@for i in $(SUBDIRS) ; do                 \
	   echo "making $(TARGET) in $${i} ..." ; \
	   ( cd $${i} && $(MAKE) $(TARGET) ) ;    \
	 done

# uninstall [un]install-pkg clean distclean
.DEFAULT:
	$(MAKE) gen TARGET=$@

.PHONY: all gen install			\
	Makefile.prj Makefile.inc	\
	local.prj local.inc local.mak

-include local.mak
